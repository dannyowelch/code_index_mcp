# Research: C++ Codebase Index MCP Server

**Phase**: 0 - Outline & Research  
**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Purpose**: Technical research for efficient indexing of large C++ codebases

## Research Findings

### 1. C++ Parsing Libraries and Tools

**Decision**: LibClang with Tree-sitter hybrid approach

**Rationale**: 
- **LibClang** provides the most stable API for semantic analysis with full C++ support, essential for accurate symbol resolution in complex codebases like Unreal Engine
- **Tree-sitter-cpp** complements LibClang by providing fast, incremental parsing for syntax highlighting and structural analysis
- For codebases with 100k+ files, the hybrid approach leverages LibClang's semantic accuracy where needed while using Tree-sitter's speed for lightweight operations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Pure LibClang**: Too slow for initial indexing (can take hours for large codebases), memory intensive (GBs of RAM)
- **Pure Tree-sitter**: Lacks semantic analysis capabilities, insufficient for complex C++ features like templates and inheritance
- **Clang Bindings/LibTooling**: More complex integration, unstable APIs across versions, though faster than LibClang

### 2. MCP (Model Context Protocol) Libraries

**Decision**: Official Rust MCP SDK with custom server implementation

**Rationale**:
- Official Rust SDK is actively maintained by the MCP organization 
- Provides both stdio and SSE transport protocols for flexibility
- Strong community ecosystem with production-ready servers for code analysis

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Custom implementation**: More control but maintenance overhead
- **Python/TypeScript SDKs**: Better documented but performance overhead for large codebases

### 3. SQLite Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: SQLite with WAL mode, memory mapping, and partitioned schema

**Rationale**:
- SQLite can handle 100GB+ datasets efficiently when properly configured
- WAL mode provides 60% performance improvement for large datasets
- Memory mapping reduces syscalls and improves cache utilization
- Partitioning by date/module enables faster queries and easier maintenance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **PostgreSQL**: Overkill for single-machine indexing, deployment complexity
- **Embedded databases (RocksDB, LMDB)**: Better for write-heavy workloads, but less SQL flexibility

### 4. Incremental Indexing Techniques

**Decision**: Git-aware Merkle tree with file watching

**Rationale**:
- Merkle trees enable O(changes) indexing complexity instead of O(repository)
- Git integration provides accurate change detection across branches
- File watching handles real-time updates during development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Timestamp-based**: Unreliable across systems and git operations
- **Full reindexing**: Too slow for large codebases (hours for UE5)

### 5. Memory-Efficient Processing

**Decision**: Streaming parser with memory-mapped files and bounded queues

**Rationale**:
- Memory-mapped files can achieve 7GB/s read speeds when OS-cached
- Streaming processing keeps memory usage constant regardless of file size
- Bounded queues prevent memory exhaustion during batch processing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Load entire files**: Memory exhaustion on large files (some UE5 files >100MB)
- **Standard file I/O**: 5x slower than memory mapping for large files

### 6. Cross-Platform Considerations

**Decision**: Rust with platform-specific optimizations

**Rationale**:
- Rust provides excellent cross-platform support out of the box
- Platform-specific optimizations can be conditionally compiled
- Single codebase maintenance with native performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **C++**: Compilation complexity, memory safety issues
- **Go**: Slower parsing performance, larger memory footprint

## Architecture Recommendations

### Core Dependencies
- **rusqlite**: SQLite integration with Rust safety guarantees
- **tree-sitter**: Fast, incremental parsing
- **clang-sys**: LibClang bindings for semantic analysis
- **mcp-rust-sdk**: Official MCP protocol implementation
- **tokio**: Async runtime for concurrent file processing
- **memmap2**: Memory-mapped file I/O
- **walkdir**: Efficient directory traversal
- **git2**: Git integration for change detection

### Performance Targets Validation
- **100k+ files**: Achievable with streaming processing and incremental updates
- **Indexing speed**: <30s for large changes using Merkle tree change detection
- **Query response**: <100ms using optimized SQLite with proper indexing
- **Memory usage**: Bounded by streaming architecture, typically <500MB

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Parsing Layer**: Tree-sitter for fast structural analysis + LibClang for semantic analysis
2. **Storage Layer**: Optimized SQLite with WAL mode and partitioning
3. **Incremental Layer**: Git-aware Merkle tree change detection
4. **Memory Layer**: Streaming processing with memory mapping
5. **Protocol Layer**: MCP for AI integration and tool communication
6. **Platform Layer**: Rust with conditional compilation for platform optimizations
