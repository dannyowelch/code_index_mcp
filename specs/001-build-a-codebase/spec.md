# Feature Specification: C++ Codebase Index MCP Server

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-codebase`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a codebase index MCP that focuses on C++ code. The codebases will be very large (Unreal Engine, Linux Kernel) so the indexer needs to be fast, lean, and well-optimized. Use sqlite to store the index and research an efficient method for storing metadata about the code without storing massive amounts of data in the database. The tool should have a single executable that controls indexing, updating an index, deleting an index, and other necessary management operation. This tool should have a menu and prompt users for any required inputs to perform the task. This will be a local MCP server using STDIO. The goal of the project is to enable agentic AI coding assistants to work with large codebases effectively. Most users of this product will be on Windows, so it should have good support for that operating system, although Git bash or WSL2 can be used as needed."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
AI coding assistants and developers working with large C++ codebases need to efficiently index and search code across massive projects like Unreal Engine or Linux Kernel. They require a fast, local indexing service that can quickly locate functions, classes, definitions, and references without storing excessive data or consuming too much memory. Users interact through a menu-driven interface to manage indices and connect AI assistants through MCP protocol for code exploration.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a large C++ codebase (100k+ files), **When** user initiates indexing, **Then** system creates searchable index within reasonable time and memory constraints
2. **Given** an existing index, **When** codebase changes occur, **Then** system updates only affected portions of the index efficiently
3. **Given** an indexed codebase, **When** AI assistant queries for specific code elements, **Then** system returns relevant results with location information via MCP protocol
4. **Given** multiple codebases, **When** user manages indices, **Then** system provides menu options to create, update, delete, and switch between different indices
5. **Given** Windows environment, **When** user runs the tool, **Then** system operates correctly with proper file path handling and performance

### Edge Cases
- What happens when indexing encounters corrupted or inaccessible files?
- How does system handle extremely large files that might exceed memory limits?
- What occurs when concurrent access attempts are made to the same index?
- How does system behave when storage space becomes insufficient during indexing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST index C++ source code files (.cpp, .h, .hpp, .cc, .cxx) in large codebases efficiently
- **FR-002**: System MUST store code metadata in local database without excessive storage overhead
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide menu-driven interface for index management operations
- **FR-004**: System MUST support creating new indices for different codebases
- **FR-005**: System MUST support updating existing indices when source code changes
- **FR-006**: System MUST support deleting indices and associated data
- **FR-007**: System MUST operate as MCP server using STDIO communication protocol
- **FR-008**: System MUST enable AI assistants to query indexed code elements and locations
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle Windows file system paths and conventions correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST prompt users for required inputs during operations
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain performance with codebases containing 100,000+ files
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide single executable for all functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST extract and index code symbols (functions, classes, variables, definitions)
- **FR-014**: System MUST track file locations and line numbers for indexed elements
- **FR-015**: System MUST support incremental updates without full re-indexing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Code Index**: Represents searchable metadata about C++ code elements including symbols, locations, and relationships
- **Codebase**: A collection of C++ source files that form a project or repository to be indexed
- **Code Element**: Individual components like functions, classes, variables, includes that are extracted and indexed
- **Index Entry**: Database record containing symbol information, file path, line number, and relevant metadata
- **MCP Query**: Request from AI assistant for code information with search parameters and response data
